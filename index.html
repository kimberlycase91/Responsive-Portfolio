            <p>I am from a small town in Northern Arizona, called Show Low (which was literally named after a card game). After graduating high school in 2009, moved to Tucson to attend the University of Arizona, where I studied Elementary Education.
            </p>
            <p>After graduating, I remained in Tucson, where I taught for the last six years. I recently moved to the valley, where I now teach 4th grade Math and Science. Although I have enjoyed teaching, I am looking forward to a career change.
            </p>
            <p>I have a five year old son named Brighton, and I also live with my autistic brother, Matthew. They are my motivation, because I want to be able to give them a great life. I want to be able to say yes more than I have to say no. In our freetime, my son and I enjoy going for bike rides and nature walks. We also enjoy going to the park and swimming when we can, of course, we prefer the beach!!
